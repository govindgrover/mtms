# Quick Start

Several quick start options are available:

- Install from pip: `pip install mtms`
- Clone the repo: `gh repo clone govindgrover/mtms`
- Clone the repo: `https://github.com/govindgrover/mtms.git`


Then to run the system,
```python
>>> import mtms
>>> mtms.run()
```
<br />

# Configuration 
You can change the default configurations in the file:
```python
<python-path>/Lib/site-packages/mtms/base/config.py
```

The default configuration  is as follow:
```python
# DATABASE INITIALS
__DB_USER__ = 'root'
__DB_PASS__ = 'password'
__DB_HOST__ = 'localhost'
__DB_NAME__ = 'metro_db'

# MUST BE IN 24-hour FORMAT
# AT WHICH OF CLOCK THE STATIONS WILL OPEN
__TRAIN_TIME_START__ = 9
# AT WHICH OF CLOCK THE STATIONS WILL CLOSE
__TRAIN_TIME_END__ = 23

# SECURITY AMOUNT TO BE TAKEN FROM THE CUSTOMER
__NEW_CARD_SECURITY__ = 50
# MINIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RECHARGED
__MIN_CARD_RECHARGE_AMOUNT__ = 200
# MAXIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RECHARGED
__MAX_CARD_RECHARGE_AMOUNT__ = 2000

# TIME FOR WHICH ONE CAN STAY AT STATION WHICH BEING ON THE TRAIN
__IN_STATION_TIME_DIFF__ = '00:20:00'

# WANT TO USE QR OR NOT
__USE_QR__ = True
```

In the above <b>\_\_DB\_NAME\_\_</b> the database name must match which is given in the initial database file. so it will be good if you take care of it. Otherwise if you really want to change it, you can do it at:

```python
<python path>/Lib/site-packages/mtms/initials/database/metro_db_struct.sql
```

## Understanding the System

<br />

Aim of this module is to bring easiness for everyone who works as a staff member at metro or a daily job person who uses metro as transport.

**Metro Train Management System** helps one to manage different stations and their routes along with the counter system and customer booking system.

<br />

## Limitations

- Line Routes are mentioned but there is no use of them because then it will become more tedious on our hand.
- Customer cannot view his/her journey going on screen.
- Customer has to remember a 36-character long token/card ID.

<br />
